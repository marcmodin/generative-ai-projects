# Exploring Prompts

This is the `exploring-prompts` directory. It is for playing around with Langchain prompt templates and other related things.


## Prerequisites

This project requires Python and Jupyter Notebook to be installed on your machine. I personally use VSCode with the Python and Jupyter Extensions. 

## Installation

To set up a virtual environment and install the required packages, follow these steps:

1. Install the virtual environment package if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Then install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
